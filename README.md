## Pier-Solar

Created for the "That's Slippery" and "Nerves of Steel" achievements.

Will be initially creating for the ChronuxMax on an Xbox One but feel free to commit a script for other platforms - be sure to include what peripheral you're using the script for.

[You can find the user manual/syntax here.](https://cronusmax.com/manual/gpc_guide.htm?ms=AgAAAAAAAAI%3D&st=MA%3D%3D&sct=MA%3D%3D&mw=MzIw#)

I figured it would be best to create separate scripts for the two achievements to start off with. Once the to are working then they could just be merged I guess.
