Created for the "That's Slippery" and "Nerves of Steel" achievements, since they're absolutely ridiculous to obtain legitimately.

Will be initially creating for the ChronuxMax on an Xbox One but feel free to commit a script for other platforms - be sure to include what peripheral you're using the script for.
